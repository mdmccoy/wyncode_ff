Wynwalk is a web app designed to accompany you when you walk around the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami. 

You can take photos of your favorite murals and street art and post them on the app for others to check out and review. 

You can add a location to your photos, which allows you to look at the Google Street View and see where the photo was taken and how things have changed in the neighborhood.
